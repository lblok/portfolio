        I'm Lucy Block. I make <a href="http://displacementalert.org" target="_blank">housing data tools</a> and do research and policy at the <a href="http://anhd.org" target="_blank">Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development</a>. I got a degree in Urban Planning from Hunter College in 2017, where I became dramatically nerdier than I already was. It turns out I love spatial analysis and interpreting the zoning resolution, among other things. I'm deeply committed to applying my technical (and non-technical) skills to advancing social change led by communities of color in New York City.

        I consider myself very lucky to get to work at ANHD, which is an organization that uses community organizing, advocacy, policy research, and capacity building to ensure the right of marginalized New Yorkers to live and thrive in this city. Before I was at ANHD, I learned a lot by working at these places:
    </p>
    <div class="worklist">
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.cypresshills.org/" target="_blank">Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation</a> (2016-2017): I was placed in CHLDC's organizing department as a graduate fellow via ANHD's Morgan Stanley fellowship. I worked on building a data tool that would help tenant organizers identify as early as possible where rent-stabilized tenants are at heightened risk of displacement. CHLDC identified this work as important in the wake of the 2016 neighborhood rezoning of East New York.
        </p>
        <p>
            NYC Economic Development Corporation [no link necessary] (2016-2017): I interned at EDC's Planning department for a year and a half, where I learned to carefully analyze zoning and apply it to potential development scenarios. I also learned the ins and outs of the ULURP (land use) and environmental review processes, which is some of the most tedious and consequential bureaucracy that exists in NYC, because it governs real estate development. I've been able to relay that knowledge to community groups butting up against plans to gentrify their neighborhoods, including for&ndash;
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://nycommons.org/" target="_blank">NYCommons</a> project (2016): NYCommons aims to equip community groups with the knowledge to shape decisions about public land and assets in NYC. Along with staff of the <a href="https://cdp.urbanjustice.org/cdp-equitable-neighborhoods target="_blank">CDP's Equitable Neighborhoods Practice</a> and <a href="http://596acres.org/" target="_blank">596 Acres</a>, I created visual materials and workshop curriculum to de-code ULURP, environmental review, zoning, and city budgeting. I also created a <a href="https://nycommons.org/resources/make-digital-map/" target="_blank">guide to digital mapping</a> that I'm proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.riissettlement.org" target="_blank">Jacob Riis Neighborhood Settlement</a> (2015-2016): Housed in Jacob Riis's Immigrant Services Department, I got to work on building a worker-owned cleaning cooperative. I was supported by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CenterforFamilyLifeSunsetPark/" target="_blank">Center for Family Life</a> in learning about building a popular education curriculum on solidarity economics/economic democracy with immigrant community members. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.prattcenter.net/" target="_blank">Pratt Center for Community Development</a> (2014 and 2015): Just as I started to learn the term "community-based planning" and understand WTF urban planning was at all (actually, that took a really long time), I got to intern at the Pratt Center, the gold standard for community-based planning in NYC. I first worked there in 2014, and what Pratt works on has shaped my interests through today: namely, building up grassroots knowledge in low-income neighborhoods of color being rezoned by the City, inequities in our land use process, and protecting/preserving the industrial economy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/pb/" target="_blank">Participatory Budgeting in NYC</a> (2014-2018): A process, not one place. I worked on PBNYC in a bunch of different capacities. First I helped canvass public housing residents with <a href="https://www.cvhaction.org/" target="_blank">Community Voices Heard</a> to get their ideas for projects they wanted their Council Members to fund. Traveling to NYCHA developments across the city helped me see and understand NYC in a way I never did growing up. Then, I interned with City Council's central staff to help make the citywide process more accessible. I made a mobile website to explain PB and a web map of previously approved projects. After that I joined the Steering Committee, a volunteer group helped support the process. Then I chaired the Steering Committee's Equity and Inclusion working group to focus on PB's mission to increase participation among marginalized groups that are usually excluded from democratic decisionmaking and voting. Now the Steering Committee doesn't exist anymore, but <span class="highlight">the process might change with impending reforms to the NYC charter and the potential creation of a Civic Engagement Commission that would oversee PB.</span>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.huertadelvalle.org/" target="_blank">Huerta del Valle</a> (2011-2013): Of everything I've ever worked on, I'm most proud of Huerta del Valle. I worked with founders Maria Teresa Alonso and Arthur Levine, who had brilliant visions of what 4 acres of vacant desert land could turn into. Maria organized her community, Arthur made some giant (really giant) piles of compost to build soil, and I helped put some bylaws and bureaucratic documents and visual site plans together. We used the planning processes to build community leadership and participation, and did everything bilingually in Spanish and English. Now, Huerta is a prolific community garden/urban farm and a hub of Mexican culture in the Inland Empire of Southern California. They've started a second site in Jurupa Valley. Please go check them out.
        </p>
        <p>Before that, I went to Pomona College in Southern California where I studied Environmental Analysis.</p>
